# Overview
Here at the University of St. Thomas, I have learned a lot throughout all of my classes. One of the very first courses that I took was a Justice and Peace course in which I learned about the struggles that we often do not see. This would kickoff a four year journey of great classes that taught more than just coding and problem solving. Many of these courses incorporated the University of St. Thomas' missions and convictions, pushing towards advancing the common good. To start off, I knew what I wanted to study even before starting classes. My family has a history of going into the technology field, so I naturally went into Computer Science. I was a bit reluctant at first, but after a few classes, I knew that this was a field that I wanted to commit too. 

# Project 1
One of the more fun and creative classes that I took was Creative Coding. This course aimed to explore emerging technologies in creative and interactive media production and development. Utilizing HTML, Javascript, p5.js, and much more, we explored the creative side of coding rather than basic backend coding. It felt like a fresh breath of air, switching languages and tapping into our creative side of the brain rather than following set structures that our typical computer science courses taught. We got to see objects that we created move around from one side of our screen to the other and have our cursor control different sound waves. By the end of this course, each student had finished their own personal final project. For my project, I used p5.js and ml5.js to create a hand tracker that lets you draw with your hands and it also can be used to identify certain objects with your webcamera. Here is the link to the project: https://github.com/KwazyKeng/DIMA259-Final-Project.
